# Whatalang Code Style Rules

## Python Standards
- Use Python 3.8+ features and type hints
- Follow PEP 8 for formatting and naming conventions
- Use snake_case for functions, variables, and modules
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants

## Documentation
- All public functions and classes must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstrings with type annotations
- Include examples in docstrings for complex functions
- Document exceptions and edge cases

## Error Handling
- Use custom exceptions for Whatalang-specific errors
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Include context in error messages (line numbers, tokens, etc.)
- Graceful degradation when possible

## Testing Conventions
- Use pytest for all testing
- Test names should be descriptive: `test_function_name_scenario`
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 90%+ test coverage

## Import Organization
- Standard library imports first
- Third-party imports second
- Local imports last
- Use absolute imports within the package
- Group imports by type with blank lines between groups

## Code Organization
- One class per file for major components
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Maximum function length: 50 lines
- Maximum class length: 200 lines
- Use composition over inheritance
